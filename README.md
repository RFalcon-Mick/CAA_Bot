# CAA_Bot
This CAA_Bot project aims to automate the process of attending online courses by simulating user interaction with web pages. Utilizing the Selenium library, the bot can perform tasks such as logging into course platforms, navigating to the appropriate course materials, and interacting with the course content to mimic active participation.
